Developed a Residential Property Price Prediction model, integrating advanced machine learning and optimization techniques. This project employed a Decision Tree Regressor for its interpretative strengths, combined with a Gurobi-based Linear Regression Optimization for strategic precision, achieving an R-squared value of 65.8%. The hybrid approach was crucial in accurately forecasting property prices in Melbourne, marked by low Mean Absolute Errors and high R-squared values. Also, it was demonstrated how the dual-model strategy adeptly balanced predictive accuracy with adaptability to market dynamics.
